\chapter{Preliminaries}

	In order get a better intuition about the relevant complexity landscape, PSPACE-Completeness and the gadget construction in particular, which will become very important in section \ref{chap:gadgets}, a few selected topics are briefly presented on the following pages.
	Readers which already have a background in theoretical computer science or related fields may skip these sections, as they only contain well known results.

			\caption{An overview about the complexity landscape relevant for this report. The class $\PSP$ is a superset of the known classes like $\PO$ and $\NP$. Just like the famous $\PO \stackrel{?}{=} \NP$ problem, it is still unknown whether $\PO \stackrel{?}{=} \PSP$. One interesting aspect, which is already indicated in the figure, is the fact that $\PSP=\NPSP$, which follows as a corollary from \textit{Savitch's theorem} \cite{Savitch.1970, Arora.2010}.}

		In the following sections the most important complexity classes relevant for this report are characterized \todo{Klingt schei√üe} and described in a intuitive way.
		As shown in the well known complexity class hierarchy in figure \ref{fig:prelims:landscape}, classes like $\PO$ and $\NP$ are contained in $\PSP$.

Turing machines are often depicted with multiple tapes \cite{Arora.2010}, but these TMs can be simulated by a TM with just one tape using only quadratically more computation time.}

			\begin{defStrich}[PTIME]
				PTIME, often abbreviated with just \textit{P}, is a complexity class which contains all \textit{decision problems} that can be solved by a deterministic turing machine in polynomial time.
			\end{defStrich}
			
			With respect to figure \ref{fig:prelims:landscape}, this means that for any decision problem in \textbf{PTIME} there exists a turing machine with can be solved after polynomial many steps.
			
			\begin{defStrich}[NPTIME]
				NPTIME, often abbreviated with just \textit{NP}, is a complexity class which contains all \textit{decision problems} that can be solved by a \textbf{non}-deterministic turing machine in polynomial time.
			\end{defStrich}
			
			Another definition which is quite common is the notion of a deterministic turing machine called a \textit{verifier} which can verify a given \textit{certificate} of polynomial length in polynomial time.

		QBF can also be used as a framework to encode and solve a variety of seemingly unrelated problems, e.g. Model Checking \cite{Baier.2008?}, Games \cite{Ani.2022} and many more applications that are beyond the scope of this report.
		For a more sophisticated overview about possible applications, the reader is referred to \cite{Shukla.2019}.
		In fact, even with very strong restrictions on the amount and type of quantifiers, these special variants of \ac{QBF} can still be used to encode many problems \cite{Balabanov.2016}.
