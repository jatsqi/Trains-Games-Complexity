\chapter{PSPACE-Completeness in Factorio}

	Over the past couple of chapters important preliminaries and the essence of gadget constructions were introduced and important results discussed.
	Of course, these results on it's own are not very useful until we use them to prove $\PSP$-Completeness of actual problems.
	A multitude of such problems is contained in the game \enquote{Factorio}, which will we the subject for the rest of the report.
	In the following we will restrict the analysis to a fraction of the games elements, namely its two most important types of \textit{transport system}: Trains and transport belts.
	Trains the belts are used to move wares, which are being produced at potentially different locations in the game world, from one place to another.
